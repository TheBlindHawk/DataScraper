# DataScraper
A global radius data scraper to grab as many university professor's emails addresses

The list is later outputted as a CSV file that can be used to send an invitation to all addresses on the list

# Notes
 - Also grabs the professor's name, surname and phone number if found.
 - Estimating around 20000 email addresses found at the end of the run.
 - This program is extremely heavy, and can take days to run.
 - This program is not optimal as it tries to check for duplicates mid run.
 - It can be used as a sample but needs major fixes to run on an average computer.
